  ### Questions:
  #### 1) Why has object-oriented programming replaced procedural programming?
              
   Answer:
  
   (1) programs written using OOP run faster on the computer
  
   (2) using OOP allows you to create platform-independent programs
  
   **(3) OOP reduces the complexity of software development**
  
   (4) OOP allows you to increase the reliability of the created software
   

   #### 2) Which of the following is an advantage of OOP?
            
   Answer:

   (1) providing the ability to modify individual software components without changing the rest of its components

   (2) enabling the creation of platform-independent programs

   (3) increase the speed of program execution

   **(4) ensuring the reusability of individual software components**
   
   
   #### 3) Which of the following is a disadvantage of OOP?

   Answer:

   (1) inefficiency in terms of memory allocation

   **(2) unification of programs through standard components**

   (3) excessive versatility

   (4) inefficiency in terms of modifying individual components
   
  #### 4) What are the benefits of providing access to class properties only through its methods?

   Answer:

   **(1) you can control the correct values ​​of the class fields**

   (2) helps to reduce the amount of code generated to describe similar entities

   (3) you can change the storage method

   (4) code written using this principle is easier to debug

   (5) makes it easier to implement polymorphism 
   

 #### 5) Which statements about encapsulation are correct?

   Answer:

   **(1) allows you to control the correct values ​​of the class fields**

   (2) helps to reduce the amount of code generated to describe similar entities

   **(3) allows you to hide the class implementation**

   (4) allows you to change the way data is stored

   (5) allows objects with the same specification to have different implementations
